# Mission10

Hello TA for 413. I am sure you are wondering why this is in a zip file. The answer: Visual Studio's version control for mac is completely broken. It never recognizes all of the changes or new files that are added when I do anything to my projects. I also can't re-upload it to a new repository because if I copy the project it re-links with my old Mission7 repository (which doesn't seem to track changes correctly.) If there is a fix for this I would love to know what it is. Thanks!
